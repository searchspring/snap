## Debugging

## Branch Overrides  

This functionality is only currently possible with Searchspring managed Snap repositories (https://github.com/searchspring-implementations).

While browsing a page that contains a Snap integration, appending the `?searchspring-preview=[branchname]` query parameter to the URL will stop the execution of the existing script, and load the build from the `[branchname]` branch `https://snapui.searchspring.io/[siteid]/[branchname]/bundle.js`

You will see an interface overlay on the bottom right of the viewport indicating if successful and details of the build.

This will also be persisted across page navigation. To stop previewing a branch build, you must click the `Stop Preview` button in the interface or clear the `ssBranch` cookie. The interface can also be minimized. 


## Development Mode

While browsing a page that contains a Snap integration, appending the `?dev` query parameter to the URL will set the controller's `environment` property to `development`. 

This is commonly used to enable visibility of development logs in the console.
