## What is Snap?

Snap is not an acronym! Snap is Searchspring's open source SDK for integrating into front end web apps. It replaces the previous AJAX v3 SDK.

Snap supports Searchspring's latest features and utilizes our latest API release for lightning fast performance.

Snap also supports integration with modern front end frameworks such as React and Vue 3. In addition, we've also released a full React (Vue 3 soon to come) component library to get you up and running quickly.
