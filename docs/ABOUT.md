## What is Snap?

Snap is not an acronym! Snap is an open source SDK for building e-commerce experiences powered by Athos Commerce.

The SDK includes multiple core packages published to npm that in combination with each other, provide the complete front-end tooling for building e-commerce experiences with Athos Commerce. However to simplify usage, the `@searchspring/snap-preact` package is an abstraction that combines all core packages into a single dependency in combination with Preact to render the UI. This documentation is primarily focused on the usage of this package.
