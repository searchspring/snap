# Snap Tracker

The Snap Tracker is a core service available on each controller via `controller.tracker`. It is responsible for sending beacon events. Its class directly extends the [beacon.js](https://github.com/searchspring/beacon.js) `Beacon` class, therefore all methods and properties of the Beacon class are available on the Tracker class.


## Snap Integration Usage
See [Integration Tracking](https://github.com/searchspring/snap/tree/main/docs/SNAP_TRACKING.md) for how and where to implement tracking events.
