# RecommendationController

The `RecommendationController` is used when making queries to the API `recommend` endpoint. It can also bind events to DOM elements to handle user input of queries.

## Initialize
Invoking the `init` method is required to subscribe to changes that occur in the UrlManager. This is typically done automatically prior to calling the first `search`.

```js
recommendationController.init();
```

## Search
This will invoke a search request to Searchspring's search API and populate the store with the response.

```js
recommendationController.search();
```

## AddToCart
This will invoke an addToCart event (see below). Takes an array of Products as a parameter. 

```js
recommendationController.addToCart([recommendationController.store.results[0]]);
```

## Events
### init
- Called with `eventData` = { controller }
- Done once automatically before the first search - or manually invoked by calling `init`

### error
- Called with `eventData` = { controller, error }
- Invoked when an error has been caught within the controller

### beforeSearch
- Called with `eventData` = { controller, request }
- Always invoked before an API request is made 
- Sets `controller.store.loading = true`

### afterSearch
- Called with `eventData` = { controller, request, response }
- Always invoked after an API request is made 
- Sets `controller.store.loading = false`
- Cancels search if input doesn't match current urlManager input state

### afterStore
- Called with `eventData` = { controller, request, response }
- Always invoked after data has been stored in mobx store

### track.product.clickThrough
- Called with `eventData` = { controller, event, result, trackEvent } 
- Always invoked after `track.product.clickThrough()` or `track.product.click()` method has been invoked
- Allows for adding custom product click events (ie. Google Analytics)

### track.product.impression
- Called with `eventData` = { controller, result, trackEvent } 
- Always invoked after `track.product.impression()` method has been invoked

### track.product.render
- Called with `eventData` = { controller, result, trackEvent } 
- Always invoked after `track.product.render()` method has been invoked

### track.product.addToCart
- Called with `eventData` = { controller, product, trackEvent } 
- Always invoked after `track.product.addToCart()` method has been invoked

### addToCart
- Called with `eventData` = { controller, products } 
- Always invoked after `controller.addToCart()` method has been invoked
