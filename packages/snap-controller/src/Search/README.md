## Initialize
Invoking the `init` method is required to subscribe to changes that occur in the UrlManager. This is typically done automatically prior to calling the first `search`.

```typescript
searchController.init();
```

## Search
This will invoke a search request to Searchspring's search API and populate the store with the response.

```typescript
searchController.search();
```

## Search History
Search queries made by the controller are stored for later usage. This is enabled by default without providing any settings, to disable set the `max` to zero. The `config.settings.history.url` setting should be set when utilizing the history store outside of the search page in order for the URLs to direct users to the correct location. Common usage of the historical terms are on the search listing page or within autocomplete.

## Infinite
When `config.settings.infinite` is defined and `store.pagination.next.url.go({ history: 'replace' })` is invoked, the next page will be fetched and its result set will be appended to the existing result set.

If the page has been reloaded, the results will be reset to page 1.

```typescript
const searchConfig = {
	id: 'search',
	globals: {
		pagination: {
			pageSize: 12
		}
	},
	settings: {
		infinite: {}
	}
};
```

### Backfill
If `config.settings.infinite.backfill` is specified, any page reloads when paginated up to the specified value will fetch previous pages to backfill.

```typescript
const searchConfig = {
	id: 'search',
	globals: {
		pagination: {
			pageSize: 12
		}
	},
	settings: {
		infinite: {
			backfill: 5
		}
	}
};
```

For example, if `config.settings.infinite.backfill` contains a value of `5` and the user has paginated to page `4` and reloads the page, `4` pages of results will be shown. However, if the user has paginated to page `6` or above and reloads the page, only page `1` results will be shown. 

### Restore Position
Any time you navigate back to a previous page, this setting will tell the controller to attempt to scroll to the previous position on the page. The restore position algorithm uses a selector that was stored when tracking the product that was clicked (`track.product.click()`) - this saves the product href, selector and domRect position details. For this to work properly, it is important that each product has a unique URL assigned to it in `mappings.core.url`. The functionality was made to work out of the box on many types of sites, but if it does not work, it can be disabled and left entirely up to the browser by setting `restorePosition.enabled` to `false` (the default setting unless using `config.settings.infinite`).

When using infinite scroll, it is recommended to specify a value for `config.settings.infinite.backfill` to ensure that when returning to the product listing page, that the product is there to scroll to.

```typescript
const searchConfig = {
	id: 'search',
	globals: {
		pagination: {
			pageSize: 12
		}
	},
	settings: {
		infinite: {
			backfill: 5,
		}
		restorePosition: {
			enabled: false,
		}
	}
};
```


### Pagination Settings 

#### `pageSizeOptions` property
The optional `pageSizeOptions` property gives the ability to overwrite the default page size options in the SearchPaginationStore. These are typically used in a `<select>` dropdown to change the number of results displayed per page. You can pass in as many options as you need. Each option has a `label` and a numeric `value`. The SearchPaginationStore then automatically populates and updates the `url` and `active` values. 

`label` - label text to display

`value` - number of results for this selection

`url` - reference to the URLManager containing href and onclick values

`active` - boolean stating if current page size matches the value of this option


```typescript
const searchConfig = {
	id: 'search',
	settings: {
		pagination: {
			pageSizeOptions: [
				{
					label: `show 30`,
					value: 30,
				},
				{
					label: `show 40`,
					value: 40,
				},
				{
					label: `show 50`,
					value: 50,
				},
			]
		},
	}
};
```


### Infinite Scrolling
By default when using the infinite configuration, additional pages are appended when `store.pagination.next()` is invoked. To automatically request the next page when the user has scrolled to the bottom, an `useIntersection` hook along with a `useRef` attached to an element below the results can be used to invoke `pagination.next.url.go({ history: 'replace' })` when the element comes into the viewport. 

```jsx
import { h, Fragment, Component } from 'preact';
import { useRef } from 'preact/hooks';
import { observer } from 'mobx-react';
import { ControllerProvider, useIntersection, Results } from '@searchspring/snap-preact-components';

@observer
export class Content extends Component {
	render() {
		const controller = this.props.controller;
		const {
			store: { pagination, merchandising, loading },
		} = controller;

		const infinite = useRef(null);
		const atBottom = pagination.totalResults > 0 ? useIntersection(infinite, '50px') : false;
		if (atBottom && pagination.next && !loading) {
			setTimeout(() => {
				pagination.next.url.go({ history: 'replace' });
			})
		}
		return (
			<ControllerProvider controller={controller}>
				<Results results={controller.store.results}>		
				<div style={{ display: loading ? 'none' : 'block' }} ref={infinite}></div>
			</ControllerProvider>
		);
	}
}

```

## Events

### init
- Called with `eventData` = { controller }
- Done once automatically before the first search - or manually invoked by calling `init`

### error
- Called with `eventData` = { controller, error }
- Invoked when an error has been caught within the controller

### beforeSearch
- Called with `eventData` = { controller, request }
- Always invoked before an API request is made 
- Sets `controller.store.loading = true`

### afterSearch
- Called with `eventData` = { controller, request, response }
- Always invoked after an API request is made 
- Invokes `window.location.replace()` if API response contains merchandising redirects AND if `config.settings.redirects.merchandising = true` (default)
- Invokes `window.location.replace()` to redirect to product detail page if API response returned a single product AND `config.settings.redirects.singleResult = true` (default)
- Sets `controller.store.loading = false`

### afterStore
- Called with `eventData` = { controller, request, response }
- Always invoked after data has been stored in mobx store

### restorePosition
- Called with `eventData` = { controller, element }
- If an element position data exists, `element` data will include `domRect` (of the element with selector), `href` and `selector`
- Invoked during final stages of `afterStore` just prior to setting loading state to false

### track.product.render
- Called with `eventData` = { controller, product, trackEvent } 
- Always invoked after `track.product.render()` method has been invoked

### track.product.impression
- Called with `eventData` = { controller, product, trackEvent } 
- Always invoked after `track.product.impression()` method has been invoked

### track.product.clickThrough
- Called with `eventData` = { controller, event, product, trackEvent } 
- Always invoked after `track.product.clickThrough()` or `track.product.click()` method has been invoked

### track.product.addToCart
- Called with `eventData` = { controller, product, trackEvent } 
- Always invoked after `track.product.addToCart()` method has been invoked

### track.product.redirect
- Called with `eventData` = { controller, redirectURL, trackEvent } 
- Always invoked after `track.product.redirect()` method has been invoked

### addToCart
- Called with `eventData` = { controller, products } 
- Always invoked after `addToCart()` method has been invoked
