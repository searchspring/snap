# Snapps Co-Development
Clone existing snap implementations here and test and develop the ecosystem with it.

### Usage

After cloning project run `npm install` from the main directory to install the implementation dependencies.

:warning: Snap package versions must line up for this to work as expected.

Multiple snapps may conflict with ip addresses when running `npm run dev`. This may require port configuration changes to work as expected.
