# Packages
The Snap mono-repo publishes multiple packages to NPM's registry; packages are versioned together, and it is recommended to utilize packages of the same exact versioning.

Documentation for each package can be found in its respective README file (`/packages/`).

# Prerequisite

## Node.js
We recommend usage of Node.js v16 or higher.
## NPM v7.x

NPM v7.x is required for its workspaces feature

NPM v7.7.0 is optional for executing scripts in workspaces

# Commands
While at the <b>repo root</b>, the following commands are available:

## Install dependencies
```shell
npm install
```

## Build
Executes `npm run build` across all packages sequentially. 
```shell
npm run build
```

Executes `npm run dev` across all packages sequentially. All packages will be linked with hot reloading.
